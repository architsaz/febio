agh137.1            yes     diff                                      red region helpful to rupture
agh148.1            yes     diff + compact     compact + flow pulse   red region is the next worse nominated   
cta3_le.1           yes     diff    
cta4                yes     delta                                     THERE IS ANOTHER CRITICAL DIFF LINE BUT NOTHING HAPPEN      
cta5                yes     sliding + swrilling                                     
micro13             yes     small surface + high Smax                 The rupture site is not on bleb 
mri8                yes     diff + swrilling                          
newCTA23            yes     2 diff region + high Smax
uic005.1            yes?     small region + swrilling + high Smax      Aneurysm growth on the critical line :-)
                            or maight be flow pulse on critical lines + high Smax                   
uic020.1            yes     there is 5 regions ( diff + swrilling + high Smax) on the Smax vector field but the fatty region moderate stress but rupture happen         
uic021.1            yes     can find 2 diff in the rupture site
uic023.1            yes     diff                                        I could not find any notion to justify the thinner region 
uic024.1            yes     small surface + diff 
uic036.1            yes     close to the High Smax
uic037.1            yes     diff                                            but the without mask shows better the diff area 
uic038.1            yes     small surface 
uic054.1            yes     diff 
uic055.1            yes?    diff close to the rupture site 
uic058.1            yes     diff
